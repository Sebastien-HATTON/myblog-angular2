# myblog-angular2
Source code for my blog using angular2 with angular universal rendering and drupal CMS

This is just a demo of using Angular universal for server side rendering fetching data from a Drupal backend that I use for my personal blog at [https://www.joaogarin.com/](https://www.joaogarin.com/). The code by itself without a backedn will not do anything but feel
free to poke around and ask some questions!
